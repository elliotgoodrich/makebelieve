# makebelieve Manifest

A manifest describes generated files and the commands used to produce them.

## Variables

User variables use `$`; **makebelieve** built-ins use `%`:

```mb
$cc = clang++
$flags = -O2
```

## Generated Files

Generated files live in the mounted output namespace and use `@/`:

```mb
@/output.txt = run cp input.txt %out
```

Paths without `@/` refer to the normal filesystem.

An output is assigned an action and what that action applies to. With
`run` the command writes the output itself, to the path `%out` stands
for. That path is a scratch file with the same name as the output, so
a tool that picks its format from the extension needs no extra argument
to say so:

```mb
@/paper.pdf = run pandoc paper.md -o %out
```

With `capture` the command writes nothing, and the bytes it sends
to standard output are the output:

```mb
@/version.txt = capture git describe --tags
```

`copy` takes a path rather than a command: the output is the bytes of
that file, read without running anything.

```mb
@/config.json = copy etc/config.json
```

The path is relative to the manifest's directory and must stay inside
it, so the file is always one **makebelieve** can watch - a copy is
rebuilt when its source changes even where command tracing is
unavailable.

`tracing` takes no argument: the output is a trace of what
**makebelieve** itself has been doing - every file opened through the
mount, every build with its command and how long it took, and an arrow
from the open that asked for a build to the build itself. Each reading
process gets a group of its own, named after its executable, and
**makebelieve** another for its own threads and builds. Within a group,
work goes on rows (`reader`, `build`) that are reused as it finishes, so
a group holds as many rows as it ever had work running at once. It is in
the
[Trace Event Format](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CvAClvFfyA5R-PhYUmn5OOQtYMH4h6I0nSsKchNAySU/preview),
ready to open in [Perfetto](https://ui.perfetto.dev) or
`chrome://tracing`.

```mb
@/tracing.json = tracing
```

Recording runs from the moment the mount starts, whether or not a
`tracing` rule exists, keeping the most recent 64 MiB of events. Every
open of the output takes a fresh snapshot. That rewrite is not
announced as a change, so a tool that rereads files when told they
changed does not reread the trace forever.

## Rules

Reusable commands can be declared as rules:

```mb
!cc = clang++ $flags -c %in -o %out
    flags = -O2
```

Invoke them by name, prefixed with `!`:

```mb
@/foo.o = !cc foo.cpp
    flags = -O0 -g
```

Without the `!`, the right-hand side is a built-in action (`run`,
`capture`, `copy` or `tracing`) and its argument, if it takes one.

## Directory Expansion

A wildcard can create one output per matching input:

```mb
@/out/*.o = !cc src/*.cpp
```

For now, only the simple single-`*` case is defined.

## Serving

The manifest in the current directory is served at a mountpoint with:

```sh
makebelieve mount <mountpoint>
```

This runs in the foreground and serves the outputs until stopped, either
by Ctrl+C or, from another terminal, by:

```sh
makebelieve unmount <mountpoint>
```

`unmount` signals the instance serving that mountpoint to shut down and
blocks until it has fully torn down.
